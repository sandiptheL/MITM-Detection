# MITM-Detection
The man in the middle attack is a serious issue, in which client server network is infiltrated by third party. This third party can perform his malicious activities on client, which could possibly result into great loss of user. This paper has provided a way to detect man in the middle.
In this work we have shown a method for detecting MITM attacks. This work does not follow the orthodox method of detecting the MITM by the certificate of the response obtained and checking the authenticity of it. The test results show that our method can detect MITM attacks.
